## Problem Statement

Write a NodeJS + Angular application of scheduling appointments 

Have 2 users in your application - store it in json

username:abcd password:1234 timezone:Indian Standard Time (+5:30 GMT)

username:xyz password:4321 timezone:Pacific Standard Time (-7 GMT)

 
User1 should schedule an appointment with User2 - you can store this in json/db

User2 will not have the scheduling options but can see the appointments scheduled

When user1 or user2 logs in it should show their appointment in their timezones

 
You will have 2 screens

- Login screen
- Welcome screen with the appointment information & to book new appointments.
